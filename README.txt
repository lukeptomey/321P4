OVERVIEW:

 This program creates a BTree that is made up of Nodes which are filled
 with data provided by a Gene Bank. The BTree is set up so that it can be
 searched and so that information about the tree can be provided.


INCLUDED FILES:

 * BTree.java - Handles all processes involving the BTree.
 * BTreeNode.java - Handles all processes involving the Nodes of the BTree.
 * BTreeObject.java - Handles what information can be placed in the BTree.
 * Cache.java - Handles the Cache for the overall process.
 * FileRW.java - Allows for the manipulation of files provided by the user.
 * GeneBankCreateBTree.java - Handles the creation of the BTree from the user input.
 * GeneBankSearch.java - Allows for the BTree to be searched and lets the user search the BTree.
 * README - this file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 From the directory containing all of the .java files 
 as listed above, compile all necessary files with
 the following command:
 $ javac *.java

 Run the compiled class files with the command:
 $ java GeneBankSearch <0/1(no/with Cache)> <BTree file> <query file> [<cache size>] [<debug level>]

 Console output will give the results after the program finishes.
